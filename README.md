What is TAILOR'D?
TAILOR'D focuses on making the most important choice of the day 
an easy decision; choosing the outfit you'll wear! With an 
auto-generating closet based on complementary color palettes,
and an easy way to view your closet virtually, you'll never 
spend too long trying on outfits in the morning again.


What we Used:
For TAILOR'D, we used Ionic as a framework for an iOS app. 
With Ionic, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code the front end 
and all of the user interface/interaction. The backend, written in Python
and using Flask, determined which images matched the color palettes and
returned that information to our front end.

What I worked on:
Wrote the autogenerator that matches the correct outfits and grabs the correct
colors depending on which items you chose.  I used Flask written in Python to
do all the server-side stuff. Ideally we would want to store the colors such 
that it is auto-detected, however, because it's a hackathon we didn't have 
time to implement a lot of what we wanted to do.
